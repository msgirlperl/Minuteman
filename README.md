# Minuteman

This is a website I'm working on for Minuteman Arc Early Intervention.

It enables a provider to give out the link to families to pull down documents.  They will be able to filter based on various attributes.  
There will be a secure section accessed via OAuth that will allow an admin to upload new documents, as well as associate attribues with
existing documents.
